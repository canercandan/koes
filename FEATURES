- Binary tree storing expressions and conclusions (respect priority)
- Be able to set several facts to one value (A&B&C&D=true)
- backward chaining only handle [multiply condition -> unique conclusion](A&B->C) until now
- Nice prompt allowing to add, edit and print facts and rules
- Options --filename to add one or more file containing rules and facts
- Options --true/--false allowing to set several facts to true and false
- Options --wish allowing to ask value of one fact

know-how rules:
-if A and B and ... then X
-if A or B or ... then X
-if A xor B xor ... then X
-A->X, B->X
-if not A then B
-if A then not B
 
-if A then B and C 
-if A then B or C
-if A then B xor C
-if A and B or C then D(multiple conditions)
-if A then C and B or C(multiple conclusions)
-iteractive chaining
